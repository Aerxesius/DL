            Nicholas Janikies runs a posh restaurant where customers dine amidst $250,000 worth of luxurious furnishings - eating Whoppers served on plastic trays.

						</figure>
			It's probably the swankiest Burger King anywhere - resplendent with a $6,000 crystal chandelier, fireplace, expensive rugs over a teakwood floor and all of the trappings of a high class restaurant.
			Janikies says his incredible fast food restaurant in Providence, R.I., is the Burger King of the 1990's.</p>
			<p>"The old theory of the fast-food business was you didn't want people to be too comfortable. You want people to have their food and leave in 20 minutes," says Janikies.</p>
			
			<p>That's all changing; he says, now that there's such intense competition for business. Janikies calls his fashionable hamburger joint Bankers Quarters in keeping with its expensive decor.
			"I must be an egotist. I wanted to have a landmark Burger King in downtown Providence," says Janikies who owns 26 other Burger Kings in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont.

			He admits he's having a little trouble moving the customers through the ultra-comfortable restaurant. Folks like to lounge around, read the paper and enjoy the surroundings.</p>
			<p>So Janikies' employees give each lunch-hour customer a leaflet urging them not to longer too long so others can enjoy the atmosphere - and the cash register can keep ringing. 
			But, after the rush, everybody is welcome to linger.</p>

            Reincarnation experts stunned by an amazing man who claims he was once an Egyption pharaoh, William the Conqueror and Rudolph Valentino.</p>

			<p> Alan Lee has lived an incredible 16 lives, say top researchers into reincarnation. Under hypnotic trance, he has recalled in detail his lives as famed film star Rudolph Valentino, William the Conqueror, the Egyptian ruler Kallikrates and even Noran, an alien from the distant planet Uranus.</p>
			<p>Not only does Lee recall these and other astonishing lives, but he is able to speak and write the language of the life he is recalling.
			He has astounded researchers by writing in Old English, Norman French and Egyptian hieroglyphics. In one astonishing session with Baltimore, Md., hypnotherapist Irving Mordes, Lee used his amazing psychic abilities to peer into the future and actually predict the discovery of a cure for cancer.</p>
			<p>"You see him do it and say it's impossible," saiid Mordes, who has worked with Lee for five years. "But it happens, and you can't explain it."
			Dr. H.N. Banerjee, who has investigated cases of reincarnation for 25 years, told the Herald: "Lee may well have set a record for number of previous lives revealed through hypnotic regression.  One extraordinary feature of his case is that he has the ability while under hypnosis to speak out and write in the languages of the times he claims to have lived in.</p>

			<p>Several weeks ago, Mordes put Lee in a trance and asked him to go into the future and find when cancer would be cured.Lee, a 38-year-old man who now lives in Baltimore, told Mordes that the cure for all cancers would be found in 1988 by a Dr. John Elkins. Patients would be placed in a type of decompression chamber called a “dynatractor” which would be filled with a mixture of oxygen and ozone.</p>

			<p>Perhaps Lee’s most amazing claim is that he is the reincarnation of famed silent screen heartthrob Rudolph Valentino. In trance, Lee has not only described intimate details of the actor’s life, but has written letters in Italian addressed to Rudolph’s mother in Italy. 
			Mordes once contacted the Troupers Club, made up of old movie people, in Hollywood, and talked to members who had known the silent star. The cameraman who filmed Valentino’s famed film “The Sheik,” asked Lee questions that only the actor would know. Like: How many people drove out to the location on the first day of shooting? And what happened to the car? In a trance, Lee said four people were in the car which broke down when the front right wheel broke off and rolled down the road. Incredibly, these answers, which Lee couldn’t possibly have known, were correct.</p>

More astonishing, Mordes said a handwriting expert confirmed that Lee’s signature as Rudolph Valentino matched an actual signature.

Born to a wealthy Philadelphia family, Lee dropped out of school in the 10th grade and has knocked about from one job to another.

But from his earliest years, he has been plagued with
